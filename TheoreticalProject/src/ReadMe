Usage notes:

-This application creates a Deterministic Finite Automata based off a text file that the program accepts. 
-The file has to be in a certain format in order for the application to accept the file. 
-The program then allows the user to input a string of acceptable inputs and the program outputs if it accepts 
or rejects the input string for our DFA. 


Compilation notes:

-In order for the program to run in the command line a few steps have to be taken:

1.) Open the Terminal/Command line for your machine. 
2.) Change the directory of your terminal by typing 'cd' and then type the name of the directory the program is in.
3.) Compile the program by typing 'javac' followed by program's name followed by the .java extension
4.) Once compiled, type 'java' followed by the program's name followed by the path and name of the file to be used.
